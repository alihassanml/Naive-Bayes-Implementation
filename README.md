## Overview

The Naive Bayes algorithm is widely used for text classification, spam detection, and other tasks that require a probabilistic approach to classification. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch.

## Features

- **Theory and Intuition**: Detailed explanation of the Naive Bayes theorem.
- **Implementation**: A Python-based implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Examples**: Application of the Naive Bayes classifier on example datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and methods to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
