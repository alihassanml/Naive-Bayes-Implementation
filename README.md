# Naive-Bayes-Implementation
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks. The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple yet effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.
